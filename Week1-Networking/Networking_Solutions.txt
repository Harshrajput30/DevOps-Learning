Week 1: Networking Challenge

Welcome to Week 1 of the 90 Days of DevOps - 2025 Edition! This week's focus is on Networking, a foundational skill for every DevOps professional. 
Let's dive into understanding key networking concepts, tools, and tasks essential for building a strong DevOps career.

1. Understand OSI & TCP/IP Models

OSI MODEL - OPEN SYSTEM  INTERCOMMUNICATION MODEL

Physical Layer – Transfers raw bits (0s and 1s) through cables, wires, or signals.

Data Link Layer – Transfers data between two devices on the same network and handles error detection (MAC address works here).

Network Layer – Finds the best path and delivers data using IP address (routing).

Transport Layer – Ensures reliable data delivery using TCP/UDP and manages ports.

Session Layer – Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between devices.

Presentation Layer – Converts data format, and handles encryption and compression.

Application Layer – Provides network services directly to user applications like HTTP, FTP, SMTP.


TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a connection-oriented and reliable protocol that works at the Transport Layer of the OSI model.
It ensures data is delivered accurately, in order, and without loss using mechanisms like acknowledgements, sequence numbers, and error checking.
Before sending data, TCP establishes a connection using a 3-way handshake. It is used in applications like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and email.”

Explain 3-Way Handshake (Very commonly asked)

TCP uses a 3-way handshake to establish a reliable connection between client and server.

Step 1: SYN (Synchronize)
Client sends a SYN packet to the server to request a connection.

Step 2: SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledgement)
Server replies with SYN-ACK to acknowledge the request and agree to connect.

Step 3: ACK (Acknowledgement)
Client sends ACK to confirm.

✅ Connection is now established and data transfer can begin.

2.Protocols and Ports for DevOps
Protocol	Port	Use
HTTP	    80	   Website
HTTPS	    443	   Secure Website
FTP	        21	   File Transfer
SSH	        22	   Remote Login
DNS	        53	   Domain to IP

3. Step-by-Step Guide to Create and Configure Security Groups in Azure VM

Introduction

Cloud computing allows us to create virtual servers called Virtual Machines (VMs). However, securing these VMs is very important. 
In Azure, Network Security Groups (NSG) act as a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic.

1.Login to Microsoft Azure Portal using your account.

2.Go to Virtual Machines and click Create VM.

3.Enter VM details like name, region, image, and size.

4.Go to the Networking tab during VM creation.

5.Click Create New Network Security Group (NSG).

6.Add Inbound Rule to allow Port 22 for SSH access.

7.Add Inbound Rule to allow Port 80 for HTTP (website access).

8.Add Inbound Rule to allow Port 443 for HTTPS (secure website).

9.Click Review and Create and launch the VM.

10.Connect to VM using SSH and Public IP address.

11.NSG will now control and secure traffic to your VM.

4. Networking Commands

ping – Checks connectivity between your system and a remote server.

traceroute / tracert – Shows the path (hops) taken by packets to reach the destination.

netstat – Displays active network connections and open/listening ports.

curl – Sends HTTP request to a server and retrieves the response.

dig – Performs DNS lookup to find IP address of a domain.

nslookup – Queries DNS to get domain name or IP address information.
